# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor


## Description

This webpage has been refactored to meet accessibility standards and to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. I have restructured some of the HTML elements, 
as well as, consolidated the CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements. I have also included comments, so you can 
view where the changes have been made. 


## Usage

To see these changes in the browser, open dev tools and view the console. 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
