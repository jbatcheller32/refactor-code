# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor


## Description

This webpage has been refactored to meet accessibility standards and to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. I have restructured some of the HTML elements, 
as well as, consolidated the CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements. I have also included comments, so you can 
view where the changes have been made. 


## Usage

To see these changes in the browser, open dev tools and view the console. 

## User Story
